\section{Introduction}
The finest diamonds in the world are hidden here.  Not hidden, actually, but dug out of the earth by the teeming masses---bare backs and bare feet, knee deep in the rust-colored mud.  The diamonds are hidden only to those who are too afraid to come here, too afraid of conflict.  These diamonds are just waiting to be plucked, begging to be sold to whoever has the means of carrying them out to the rest of world.  Expensive diamonds out there, but cheap diamonds here.  What use are diamonds, anyway, in Angola?

The local market has been soft ever since the biggest player went back to Johannesburg.   Pressure from the media lead to pressure from the public.  The public buys diamonds, so the biggest player had to listen.  But we fly under the public's radar.  We're not 100-year-old dinosaurs.  We're made-up corporations with made-up names.  Low overhead.  No permanent employees, just field agents hired as needed.  Even our offices are temporary.  Temporary, but in the right locations.  Antwerp and London---the only places that matter.


\section{How to play}
There are only two firms left with agents in Angola.  We've gotten good takes while it lasted, but big changes are coming.  At first we thought the Kimberley Process was just a toothless promise from the big dealers to soothe public outcry.  Certify the origin of rough diamonds?  Sure, we can handle that.  But now we're hearing whispers about the UN. \ Seems like Kimberley may get herself some teeth in December.  But hey, that's December.  It's January now, and we've still got our contacts in Angola.  Let's make this last year count.

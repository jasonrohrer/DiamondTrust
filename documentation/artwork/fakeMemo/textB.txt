Our source inside the UN has provided us with a copy of a forthcoming Security Council report.  Here is a relevant excerpt

\begin{quote}
The Panel learned that from 1993 to 1994 much of UNITA's military equipment was procured using a South African arms dealer named Ronnie De Decker, who went by the name of "Watson". UNITA's relationship with Watson had two essential components - the first was the procurement of arms and military equipment, and the second was payment for these goods and services with diamonds. The key to the financial side of the transaction was Watson's brother -- Joe De Decker, who was at one time a De Beers site holder and currently runs De Decker Diamonds in South Africa. Typically, the De Decker brothers would travel together to Andulo using an LR35 Lear Jet, and once Watson had finished negotiating the arms component of the deal Joe De Decker would sit together with UNITA's own diamond experts to assess and value the diamond packages that UNITA presented for payment (generally packaged in parcels worth between US$4 million and US$5 million). Sometimes Watson would take the packages to Antwerp and come back with a lower counter-proposal on the value of the diamonds, claiming that this was all that he could get in Antwerp.

After reviewing the call logs from the satellite service for one of our agents, it has become clear that loyalty may be faltering.  

That agent will go unnamed in this memo, but it could just as well be any one of you, and I want to stress how important this issue is for the viability and mutual profitability of our operation during these last few months.

By working together, we can control the flow of high-grade Angola diamonds, thereby controlling the market itself.  When World Diamonds controls a share of the diamond flow, we cannot count on them to mutually control the market.  Unfortunately, the reward that we will reap from unilateral flow control will come later, long after our primary work is done.  Thus, the temptation of paid side work, potentially even with our direct competitor, is strong right now.

Let me assure you all one final time that our mutual rewards will be enormous, but only if we can maintain full loyalty and cooperation through the end.

\opening{Gentlemen:}

L has reported that the finest diamonds in the world are still there. \ Not hidden at all, but dug out of the earth by the teeming masses, bare backs and bare feet, knee deep in the rust-colored mud.  The diamonds are only hidden to those who are too afraid to go there or those without the means of carrying them out to the rest of world.  Expensive diamonds out here, but cheap diamonds there.  What use are diamonds, anyway, in Angola?

The local market has been soft ever since De Beers went back to Johannesburg.   Pressure from the media lead to pressure from the public.  The public buys diamonds, so De Beers had to listen.  But we fly under the public's radar.  We are not a 100-year-old dinosaur.  We are a made-up corporation with a made-up name.  Low overhead.  No permanent employees, just a handful of field agents hired as needed.  Even our office is temporary.  Temporary, but in the right location.  %London, the only place that matters.

There are only two firms left with agents in Angola:  DTL and our Antwerp competitor, World Diamonds.  We have both gotten good takes while it lasted, but big changes are coming.  At first we thought the Kimberley Process was just a toothless promise from the big dealers to soothe public outcry.  Certify the origin of rough diamonds?  Sure, we can handle that.  But now the district is filled with whispers about the UN. \ Seems like Kimberley may get some teeth in December.  But that's December.  It's not quite May now, and we've still got our contacts in Angola.  Let's make this last year count.


\closing{Yours Faithfully,}

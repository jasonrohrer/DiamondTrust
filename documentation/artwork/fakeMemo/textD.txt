As we anticipated, mounting UN interference has now made our continued operation in Angola untenable.  LM's detainment at the end of November was a clear signal, though our contacts were able to ensure the safety of our activities for one final month.  In particular, Inspector Harold Mills has been incredibly understanding.  We have thanked him already, and will continue to thank him more in the near term.

Clearly, our hard work through the end has paid off, and will continue to pay off, but I cannot help but feel that this happy conclusion of our operation is bitter sweet.  Working closely, and under duress, over many years would bring any group of men into each other's confidence.  But for us, the bond that we developed has exceeded all reasonable expectations.  I will always remember the Luanda Hotel, a table for four, and scotch on the rocks.

In somber conclusion to what will likely be my final written communication with you, I wish you all a happy Christmas.

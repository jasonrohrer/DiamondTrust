\section{Game goal}

At the end of 8 months, the player with the most diamonds wins.  In the event of a tie in the diamond count, the player with the most money wins.

\section{Game overview}
Each player commands three diamond-trading agents.  Your agents start out in your home base region, which is shown in the upper left of the map.  Each player starts out with 2 diamonds and \$18.

The main action in the game involves flying your agents into and around Angola to buy the diamonds that are being produced there.

\section{Buying Diamonds}
When you send an agent into a region of Angola, you must decide how much you're willing to pay for the diamonds that have accumulated in that region.  This is how much your agent will pay the diamond guide in that region.  Whoever pays the diamond guide more is lead to the diamonds and gets all of them.  However, the diamond guide always takes all of the money offered.  For example, if your agent pays \$5 and the opponent agent pays \$6 in a given region, the opponent gets all of the diamonds there and you get nothing.

In the event of a tie (e.g., both agents paying \$4), neither agent gets the diamonds, but the diamond guide still takes the money.

\section{Agent travel costs}
Flying around costs money.  Within Angola, flights between regions cost \$1, but flying between Angola and your home region (across the ocean) costs \$2.

\section{Agent loyalty}
Along with paying for diamonds, you also can pay your agents salaries and pay bribes to your opponent's agents.  An agent is loyal to whoever has paid it the most, total, so far.

To pay one of your agents additonal salary, that agent must be in your home base region.

To bribe an opponent's agent, you must have an agent in the same region as your opponent.

build an AppBundle for convertTo32768.scpt with the Apple Script Editor

build getWaveInfo.cpp into getWaveInfo in the gameSource folder.

Build sox from source.


Copy all this stuff into the App bundle, like so:

cp -r convertAllWavs convertWav ../getWavInfo ~/sox/src/sox ~/sox/src/.libs convertTo32768.app/Contents/MacOS/


So now sox and all the support scripts and exes are in the app bundle, ready to go.

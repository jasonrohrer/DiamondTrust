build an AppBundle for convertTo32768.scpt with the Apple Script Editor

build getWaveInfo.cpp into getWaveInfo in the gameSource folder.

Build sox from source.

Modify the ~/sox/src/sox  script (a local wrapper script) in the following way:

---Look for these lines and change them to look like this:

    # Add our own library path to DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
    DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="./convertTo32768.app/Contents/MacOS/.libs:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH"

In other words, change the DYLD_LIBRAY_PATH addition so that it points into our app
bundle instead of wherever the SOX build had it point.


Copy all this stuff into the App bundle, like so:

cp -r convertAllWavs convertWav ../getWavInfo ~/sox/src/sox ~/sox/src/.libs convertTo32768.app/Contents/MacOS/


So now sox and all the support scripts and exes are in the app bundle, ready to go.
